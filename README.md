### Multiple presentations on one page

This is my fast-built demo of showing multiple slides presentations on one page.
index.html contains all the markup and two slides collections, which are maintained by javascript in index.js,
i used jQuery 2.1.1 version here.
The number of presentations can be changed by (for example) copying <div class="presentation" data-class="slider-container">...</div>,
it's structure is required for my javascript to work correctly.
